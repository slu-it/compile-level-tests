# Showcase: Java Compile Levels
This repository includes code for demonstrating how the compile level of dependencies has an influence on the runtime behavior.

For this there are three modules, each dedicated to a Java version:

- `compile-level-j6`
- `compile-level-j7`
- `compile-level-j8`

The test can be executed by using either a JRE 6, 7 or 8 to execute the `main` method of the `compile-level-usage` module.
